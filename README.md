# Diceware to go

These documents are my attempt to create compact, formatted [Diceware] word lists that are easy to print out and keep to hand. Currently they consist of 

| Word list               | Size         | Pages | Formats                   |
|-------------------------|--------------|------:|---------------------------|
| [EFF short wordlist #1] | A4           | 3     | [PDF][1] [ODF][2]         |
|                         | A4           | 6     | [PDF][2] [ODF][5]         |
|                         | Credit card  | 24    | [PDF][4] [ODF][6]         |
